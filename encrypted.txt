“Iotulate Calvin Duncan on his victory,” Lombard said in a statement. “I stand ready to support a smooth and professional transition so that the important work of this office continues without interruption.”


Duncan, 62, had only an eighth-grade education when he was incarcerated but became a legal expert while still in prison, helping other inmates challenge unconstitutional practices. He later became a lawyer.

In 2020, Duncan’s legal advocacy drove the US Supreme Court to end non-unanimous jury convictions in Louisiana and Oregon, the only two states still allowing a practice rooted in the Jim Crow era.

Duncan, who recalls that it took years for incarcerated people to get access to basic court documents, says he sought the clerk position to ensure fair treatment for all and that records are treated with greater care and respect.

New Orleans’ criminal court system still relies on paper files, though the city says a digital filing system is in the works. In August, court records were mistakenly discarded, leading the clerk’s office to wade ankle-deep through a landfill to retrieve them.
