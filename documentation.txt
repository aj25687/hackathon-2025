public class Reverse {
Starts your class. Java forces you to wrap your code in a class.

public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
This is the starting point of your program.
The throws just means “if the file isn’t found, Java can throw an error.”

⸻

Scanner fileScan = new Scanner(new File("filename.txt"));
Creates a Scanner that reads from the file named filename.txt.

String data = fileScan.useDelimiter("\\A").next();
This stupid-looking .useDelimiter("\\A") trick means:
read the entire file as one single string instead of line by line.
.next() grabs that whole string.

fileScan.close();
Turns off the file scanner so you don’t leak resources.

⸻

Scanner keyScan = new Scanner(System.in);
Creates a Scanner that reads from the keyboard.

String key = keyScan.nextLine();
Reads the whole line the user typed.
Example: 10.20.30.40

keyScan.close();
Shuts down the keyboard scanner.

⸻

String[] parts = key.split("\\.");
Splits the key at every dot.
So "10.20.30.40" becomes ["10", "20", "30", "40"]

List<Integer> indexes = new ArrayList<>();
Creates an empty list that will hold the numbers.

⸻

for (String p : parts) {
Loop through each chunk of the split string like “10” then “20” etc.

if (!p.isEmpty()) {
Skip empty strings, just in case.

indexes.add(Integer.parseInt(p));
Turn the string “10” into the number 10 and add it to the list.

} ends the if
} ends the for loop

⸻

StringBuilder modified = new StringBuilder(data);
Creates a modifiable string because normal strings can’t be edited.

⸻

for (int i = 0; i < indexes.size() - 1; i++) {
Loop through the index list pair by pair
so it uses
indexes[0] and indexes[1]
indexes[1] and indexes[2]
indexes[2] and indexes[3]
etc.

int start = indexes.get(i);
This is the starting position of the segment.

int end = indexes.get(i + 1);
This is the ending position of the segment.

⸻

if (start < 0 || end > modified.length() || start >= end) {
Safety check.
If the range is impossible, skip it.

System.out.println("invalid range: " + start + " to " + end);
Tell the user the range was garbage.

continue;
Skip to the next segment.

} ends the if

⸻

String segment = modified.substring(start, end);
Grab the string chunk you want to reverse.

String reversed = new StringBuilder(segment).reverse().toString();
Reverse that chunk.

⸻

modified.replace(start, end, reversed);
Put the reversed chunk back into the big string in the same place.

⸻

} end of the for loop

⸻

System.out.println(modified.toString());
Prints the final modified string.

⸻

} end main
} end class

If you want, I can rewrite it even simpler or restructure it visually so it’s easier to see the flow.
