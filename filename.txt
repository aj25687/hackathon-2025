Yaoi is a genre in fictional (typically Japanese) stories that features male-on-male romance. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley can be compared to Yaoi tropes to explore the characters’ relationships, intentions, and interactions deeper. In Frankenstein, when viewed through the lens of Yaoi tropes, Victor Frankenstein has three different men that he could potentially romance: the creature he makes, Henry Clerval, and Robert Walton. When Victor destroys the female that the creature requests, it shows how although Victor appears to loathe the creature, his tsundere (hot-and-cold) personality reveals how he secretly feels jealous and possessive, which is how a tsundere personality acts in Yaoi. When Victor first agreed to make the female creature, it was only because of the creature feeding his ego, making him feel like a pretty princess because of the ego boost, which reflects how Victor is somewhat of a himedere (a character who likes being treated like royalty). However, upon noticing the creature watching him work on the female, Victor felt a surge of jealousy, causing him to rip up the female creature due to the romantic feelings he harbors for his creature, as suggested by the intimate usage of words like “promise”, “passion”, and “engaged” (Shelley 156). This reveals how Victor secretly feels like the creature’s attention is being diverted from him, which makes him feel possessive and angry, since he wants the creature to only have eyes for him. Because of these strong feelings, he makes a “solemn vow in [his] own heart never to resume [his] labours”, which can also be seen as Victor vowing to make sure
